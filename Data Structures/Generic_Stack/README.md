Project name: Generic Vector

This project is the implementation of a Generic Dynamic Vector.
Generic Vector is convenient to store different data-type in a single container.
We can store int, float, char variables etc in the same container.
The generic vector is in fact a vector of pointers to objects of any kind.
The size of each item in the vector is sizeof(pointer).
The vector can be dynamically resized if full capacity is reached.

FILES:

generic_vector.h = header file with descriptive API.
generic_vector.c = .c implementation file.
generic_vector_test.c = test file.
Status.h = Utility file for error status.
